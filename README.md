ReddWall
================

ReddWall sets your wallpaper to a random image from one of the many Reddit wallpaper subreddits.

What it Does
------------

On the first run, ReddWall will find a random wallpaper from /r/wallpapers and minimize to the status bar. By default, it will select a new wallpaper every 1 hour. This behavior can be changed in the preferences window that can be opened by clicking the ReddWall icon in the status bar.

Reporting Issues
----------------

This program has not been tested on many different platforms. The cross platform toolkits used (wxWidgets, Python, and PRAW) mean that it should work without a problem. However, problems are bound to arise. If you have any issues with ReddWall, please [file an issue](https://github.com/matthewbauer/reddwall/issues/new) and I'll be sure to get back to you.
